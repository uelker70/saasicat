# @saasicat/adapter-drizzle

## 1.0.0-rc.2

### Patch Changes

- 3ebc363: **`saasicat schema apply` now appends the enums a fragment declares, above the models that use
  them.** It used to copy models only, so a fresh schema ended up with `Subscription.billingCycle`
  and no `BillingCycle` — twenty Prisma validation errors at quickstart step 3 for anyone who had
  not pasted the enums in by hand. An enum the schema already declares is left untouched, as models
  are. Found by installing the 1.0 candidate from npm into an empty project; the example app had
  carried the enums since before the command existed, so nothing in the repository saw the gap.

    **Every package with an exports map now exports `./package.json`.** Seven did not, and a bundler
    plugin, `vue-tsc` or pnpm reading the manifest got `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.
    **`saasicat init` names two more things the generated wiring needs.** The `forRoot` block now
    carries `imports: [YourPrismaModule, YourAuthModule]` the way it carries `YourAuthGuard` — it does
    not compile until you name them — because `prismaPersistence({ client: PrismaService })` is
    resolved inside the platform module, which sees only what that list holds or what is `@Global`.
    Left out, the generated app compiled and stopped on its first boot with "Nest can't resolve
    dependencies of … (PrismaService)". And `init` now refuses a `tsconfig.json` whose
    `moduleResolution` is `node`: the files it writes import subpath exports, which only `node16`,
    `nodenext` or `bundler` resolve. The quickstart says so too.

    **`create-saasicat-admin` scaffolds an app that type-checks.** Its `platform-loaders.ts` still
    passed `getAuthToken` to `createPlatformLoaders`, an option the 1.0 line no longer has, so every
    fresh admin failed `vue-tsc` on its first run. The scaffolder's tests now type-check a scaffolded
    app against the `@saasicat/ui-vue` it was scaffolded for.

### Major Changes

- 9449492: **One name for everything — and a codemod that applies it.** Phase 5 of the 1.0 cut.

    `npx @saasicat/cli@latest codemod v1 --dir=.` does the surface cut from the previous
    candidates and everything below in one run. `docs/migrating-to-1.0.md` is the written
    form, with before/after for each change.

    **`SaasPlatformModule` is gone; `SaaSiCatModule` is the class**, not an alias of it.
    The thirteen `SaasPlatform*` option types are `SaaSiCat*` — `SaaSiCatModuleOptions`,
    `SaaSiCatAdapters`, `SaaSiCatCatalogOptions` and so on. `createSaasPlatformTestModule`
    is `createSaaSiCatTestModule`; `SaasicatPersistenceAdapter` and its six slice types are
    `SaaSiCatPersistenceAdapter` and `SaaSiCatPersistence*`. There is one spelling of the
    product name left: `SaaSiCat` in types and prose, `saasicat` in packages and files,
    `SAASICAT_` in constants.

    **Every registry key is `saasicat/<package>/<Name>`.** Four prefixes —
    `saas-platform/`, `saas-platform-nest/`, `saas-platform-cli/`, and `@saasicat/ui-vue/` for
    the Vue injection keys — became one. This matters only if your code calls `Symbol.for`
    with one of those strings itself; the exported token constants are unchanged in name and
    resolve as before. The keys will not be renamed again: the rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md` says
    why, and a repository test refuses any other prefix.

    **`FEATURE_UI_REGISTRY_TOKEN` has two names now**, because it meant two registries:
    `BILLING_FEATURE_UI_REGISTRY_TOKEN` from `@saasicat/nest/billing` and
    `CATALOG_FEATURE_UI_REGISTRY_TOKEN` from `@saasicat/nest/catalog`. The codemod picks by
    the entry you imported from and reports an import it cannot decide.

    **`@saasicat/ui-vue/testing-e2e/*` is `@saasicat/ui-vue/testing/*`** — the Playwright
    helper consumers run their admin pages through. Nothing else about it changed.

    Inside the repository, for anyone who reads it: the package directories are the package
    names (`packages/nest`, not `packages/saas-platform-nest`), Nest files follow
    `<area>/<name>.module.ts`, adapter files end in `.repository.ts` or `.adapter.ts`, and test
    directories are `tests/{integration,component,e2e}`. None of that reaches a consumer's
    imports.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9449492]
    - @saasicat/types@1.0.0-rc.0

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 40e270c: **The license changes from Apache-2.0 to PolyForm Shield 1.0.0.** SaaSiCat is
  source-available from this release on, not OSI open source.

    What stays permitted, and it is nearly everything: reading the code, running it,
    changing it, redistributing it, and building and selling your own SaaS product on
    top of it. What is not permitted is offering a product that competes with
    SaaSiCat itself, or with a product its author provides using it. There is no time
    limit and no reversion to a permissive license.

    **Versions up to and including 0.26.1 remain Apache-2.0.** Rights granted with a
    published version cannot be withdrawn, and npm versions are immutable — if you
    depend on 0.26.1 or earlier, nothing about your terms changes until you upgrade.

    Practically: if you use SaaSiCat to build an application, this changes nothing
    for you. If you were planning to repackage SaaSiCat itself as a product, it does.

    The reasoning, the alternatives that were weighed, and the consequences are in
    [ADR 0001](https://github.com/uelker70/saasicat/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-source-available-licensing.md).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9cf68f6: New package: the Drizzle + PostgreSQL persistence adapter — the proof that SaaSicat's ports are ORM-agnostic in practice, not just on paper.

    - `drizzlePersistence({ db })` bundle for `SaasPlatformModule.forRoot({ persistence })`, mirroring `prismaPersistence()` slice by slice (core incl. transaction runner and audit write/query/stats, entitlement with row-locked `findByTenantIdLocked`, promo repositories with atomic `claimSlot`/`releaseSlot`/`markExhaustedIfFull` as guarded UPDATE … RETURNING, SuperAdmin bootstrap, plan-catalog read/import sinks).
    - Driver-independent: typed against `PgDatabase` from `drizzle-orm/pg-core`, so node-postgres and postgres.js clients both work; row counts come from RETURNING instead of driver-specific result shapes.
    - Targets the same canonical schema (`@saasicat/spec` reference SQL) as adapter-prisma — ids and `updatedAt` are generated app-side to match Prisma's client-side behavior, enum columns are declared as text and coerced by Postgres.
    - Passes the identical `@saasicat/persistence-testing` contract against a real PostgreSQL (CI runs both adapters in the persistence-contract job), plus drizzle-specific interop tests for enum round-trips and the subscription CHECK constraint.
