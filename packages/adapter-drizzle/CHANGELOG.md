### Major Changes

- d4b294e: A contract line records the currency and the tax it was booked with

    `ContractLineItem` gains three required columns — `currency`, `taxRate` and
    `taxAmount` — and `ContractLineItemRecord`, `NewContractLineItemData` and
    `InvoiceLineItemSnapshot` gain the matching fields. An installation configures
    one currency and one rate at a time, so a line never chooses them; what the
    column is for is that a row keeps meaning what it meant after either is
    changed, which is why changing a currency once contracts exist is a migration
    rather than an edit.

    `taxRate` is stored even though net and gross both are, because the ratio
    between them is not the rate: it cannot be reproduced for a gross that was
    rounded, it cannot express an exempt or a reverse-charge line, and it does not
    survive a rate change. `taxAmount` is the gap between the line's own net and
    gross, so the row cannot disagree with itself and no reader rounds a second
    time.

    **Run `sql/1.0-line-items-record-their-money.postgres.sql` before `db push`.**
    The columns are NOT NULL, which `db push` cannot add to a table that already
    holds rows. The migration adds them, fills them from each line's own contract —
    `priceSnapshot` already records the currency and the VAT rate that were agreed
    — and only then makes them required. It refuses, naming the contract, where a
    snapshot states no currency or a rate that is not a number between 0 and 100,
    rather than inventing one; and it does nothing at all on a second run.

    **If you implement the persistence ports, your build breaks here.** A
    repository adapter has to read and write the three fields.
    `ContractFreezeSourcePort.loadBookedBundles` deliberately does not: its
    `lineItems` are now `PricedContractLineItem`, the same shape without them,
    because a source prices what it sells and the platform records the
    installation's currency and rate. An adapter that annotates its result as
    `NewContractLineItemData[]` needs that annotation dropped or changed.

    **The rate is recorded in per cent on both paths, which the checkout path did
    not do before.** A checkout offer prices its lines as `net * (1 + vatRate)` and
    so states the rate as a fraction, while the catalogue states per cent; recorded
    as they stand, one column would hold both. Which unit an offer's breakdown
    carries is now read off that breakdown's own totals rather than assumed.
    `SubscriptionContractPriceSnapshot.vatRate` is unchanged and still carries
    whichever unit the contract was concluded with — it now says so — and
    `ContractLineItemRecord.taxRate` is the one that is always per cent.

    **`SubscriptionContractService.create` refuses a line that disagrees with its
    contract.** `SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT_LINE_ITEM_TAX_MISMATCH` where `taxAmount` is
    not exactly `priceGross - priceNet`, and
    `SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT_LINE_ITEM_CURRENCY_MISMATCH` where the line's currency is
    not the one the contract was priced in. Both platform paths satisfy them, so
    these only reach a caller supplying its own line items — but a contract is
    append-only, and an invoice stating one currency in its total and another on
    every line is a record nobody can correct afterwards.

    `@saasicat/spec` also ships `schemas/tenant-ledger.schema.json`, naming the
    shapes of a per-tenant account — a charge, a payment, the origins a charge can
    have, and the account read model — with the generated types in `@saasicat/core`. A
    payment carries no tax split: the net, the rate and the tax belong to the
    charges it settles, and asking a payment for them would make an integrator
    write a number nobody knows. Nothing reads the shapes yet; the persistence and
    the service that writes charges follow.

### Minor Changes

- 3a700a4: The platform records the configuration it applied

    `config/saas.yaml` says what should be true. Until now nothing said what IS
    true, and somebody who edited the file an hour ago had no way to tell whether
    it had landed. At every start the platform now records the settings it applied
    — everything in the file but the plans and the features, with the environment
    references resolved — together with a `sha256-…` fingerprint over them, the
    moment they took effect and the file they came from.

    Three states, and almost every start is the middle one: no record → written;
    same fingerprint → nothing happens, and `appliedAt` keeps saying when these
    values took effect; different → the record is replaced and the difference is
    written down, leaf by leaf with both values, in `settings_changes`. The
    fingerprint covers the settings and not the catalogue, so a plan added to the
    file is not a configuration change — and it covers the resolved values, so a
    production variable that moved the notice period is one.

    **The record is a mirror, never a source.** Nothing reads a setting out of it;
    a record that disagrees with the file changes nothing about what runs, and a
    test holds the port to the module that writes it and the endpoint that shows
    it. `GET /admin/settings` is that endpoint: the running settings, their
    fingerprint and source, `appliedAt` where the record matches what is running,
    and the recent changes with what moved. It sits behind `controller.guards`
    like the manifest and discovery, and `includeSettingsController: false` leaves
    it out for an app that serves the path itself — the record is kept either way.

    **Two tables, one migration.** `applied_settings` holds one row — the
    installation's, held to one by a `CHECK` rather than by convention — and
    `settings_changes` one row per start that noticed a change. Run
    `sql/1.0-the-applied-settings-are-recorded.postgres.sql` once, before
    `db push` where you use one; it is safe to run again and does nothing on a
    database created from the reference schema. On the Prisma path, copy the two
    models from `prisma-fragments/12-applied-settings.prisma`.

    `AppliedSettingsPort` is a new port in `@saasicat/core`, served by both
    `prismaPersistence()` and `drizzlePersistence()` as `core.appliedSettings` and
    held to the same executable contract. It is optional in the bundle: a
    persistence adapter written before it existed still starts, and the platform
    says once, at boot, that it is not recording. `SaaSiCatAdapters.appliedSettings`
    overrides the bundle's slice like the other core ports.

    `loadPlanCatalogFromFile` now remembers the absolute path it read a catalogue
    from — `catalogSource(catalog)` returns it — which is what the record names as
    the source. A catalogue handed in as an object, or through `dbCatalog`, is
    recorded as coming from code, not from a path the platform did not read.

    `@saasicat/core` also gains `settingsSubtreeOf`, `canonicalJson` and
    `diffSettings`, the pure functions behind the fingerprint and the difference.

### Major Changes

- 89eed2b: **`projectKey` leaves the data model.** One installation serves one application,
  so a plan key, a bundle key, a feature key and a quota key are unique for the
  whole installation — and nothing carries a project above them any more.

    The column never had a second value to hold. `config/saas.yaml` named one
    project, the module resolved it once at boot, and there was no per-request
    switch; `subscriptions.tenantId` is unique installation-wide, so a customer of
    two applications in one database could not exist. What it did do was contradict
    the schema beside it: `plan_versions.planId` holds the plan **key** and no
    project, so two plans sharing a key shared one version lineage, and
    `plan_versions_draft_per_plan` then stopped the second one from opening a draft
    at all.

    **Ten tables lose the column** — `plans`, `bundles`,
    `capability_/feature_/quota_catalog_entries`, `marketing_projections`,
    `marketing_settings`, `promotions`, `checkout_offers`,
    `subscription_contracts` — and every `(projectKey, <key>)` unique index becomes
    `(<key>)`. `marketing_settings` becomes a singleton, capped by a constant
    primary key rather than by its project.

    **Run one SQL file against an existing database:**

    ```bash
    psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f node_modules/@saasicat/spec/sql/1.0-remove-project-key.postgres.sql
    ```

    It starts with a guard. Where the catalogue holds rows under more than one
    project key — in one table or spread across several — it stops and names which
    table held which, rather than merging rows that would then collide on the new
    unique index. It is a one-way door, and safe to run again: a table whose column
    has already gone is skipped.

    Each table's changes are made only where that table exists, so an app that
    adopted a subset of the Prisma fragments migrates what it has. The file also
    adds a `CHECK` keeping `marketing_settings` to one row — that was a convention
    resting on a column default, and a default does not apply to a caller that
    supplies the value.

    If your dev setup uses `prisma db push`, run the file **before** it. `db push`
    refuses to drop a column that still holds data, and adding `--accept-data-loss`
    would arm every future change to discard data unasked.

    The codemod reads your `schema.prisma` as well and reports what it finds there:
    a schema you copied the platform's models into still declares the columns, and
    a client generated from it would query them.

    **For your code**, `saasicat codemod v1` gained a third pass —
    `v1-project-key`. It removes the `?projectKey=` query part from a `/catalog/`
    URL and the key from `config/saas.yaml`, and it _reports_ every object member
    by file and line rather than removing it: in TypeScript an object literal and a
    type literal are the same tokens, so a scan that rewrote members would sometimes
    delete one of your own declarations. The upgrade guide's table says what each
    reported shape becomes.

    **What changes at the surface:**

    - `app.name` is **required** in `config/saas.yaml`; it is the one place the
      application names itself, and what the manifest and login page display.
      `dbCatalog` takes `{ app, currency, vatRate }`.
    - `SuperAdminEndpoints`, every catalogue composable and every admin resource
      drop the field; the catalogue endpoints no longer read `?projectKey=`.
    - `PlanRow`, `BundleRow`, `PromotionRow`, the catalog-entry rows,
      `MarketingProjectionRow`, `MarketingSettingsRow`, `CheckoutOfferRow`,
      `SubscriptionContractRecord` and their create/filter DTOs lose it;
      `findByKey`, `retireMissing`, `findFeature`/`findQuota`, the review, i18n and
      base setters, `countActiveByPlanKey` and `loadSnapshot` lose their first
      argument. `PromotionFilter` and `unambiguousPlanKeys` are gone.
    - Four error messages drop the phrase — `Plan 'STANDARD' already exists` — and
      the `params` entry with it. Nothing read that parameter.
    - `saasicat init --project-key` and `pnpm create saasicat-admin --project-key`
      are `--app-key`: the slug of the application, which is what they always were.

    **Three new guards, because a removal leaves no trace.** The persistence
    contract now proves a key is taken once for the installation, and that retiring
    a plan does not free it — a rule `adapter-drizzle` did not follow, and now does.
    `tests/a-key-belongs-to-the-installation.test.js` fails on the identifier coming
    back anywhere in the repository. And the migration refuses ambiguous data rather
    than merging it.

    Migration guide: [`docs/guides/upgrade-to-1.0.md`](https://github.com/uelker70/saasicat/blob/main/docs/guides/upgrade-to-1.0.md).

### Minor Changes

- 9b5ca2f: Close the last gaps in `@saasicat/adapter-drizzle`: it now serves the plan
  catalogue, the tenant's own subscription writes, and subscription contracts, so
  the persistence contract runs against it with no scenario skipped.

    `drizzlePersistence()` now returns the `catalog` and `tenantBilling` slices, so
    `SaaSiCatModule.forRoot` can discover the plan catalogue, the tenant's billing
    page and the writes behind its buttons without a consumer wiring any of it by
    hand. Four classes are new: `DrizzlePlanRepository`,
    `DrizzleTenantSubscriptionWrite`, `DrizzleSubscriptionContractRepository` and
    `DrizzleSubscriptionUsageAdapter`. The `subscriptions` query map was also
    missing nineteen canonical columns, including `currentPeriodEnd`,
    `billingAnchorDay`, `minimumTermUntil` and `trialEndsAt`; a new derived test
    compares every `pgTable` against the reference schema and fails on an omitted or
    invented column.

    The persistence contract's contract-lifecycle scenario was a placeholder that
    failed if an adapter provided the repository at all. It is now two real
    scenarios — what a contract stores and what ending one does, and how a successor
    takes over — and both adapters plus the in-memory reference implementation pass
    them.

    `@saasicat/core` gains the pieces both adapters were spelling out separately:
    `toPlanRow`, `toPlanVersionRow`, `toSubscriptionContractRecord` and
    `toContractLineItemRecord` map canonical rows to records in one place,
    `previousUtcDay` and `ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_CONTRACT_STATUSES` are the window and
    status rules the adapters share, and
    `CancelSubscriptionInput`/`CancelSubscriptionResult` name a shape that was
    written out three times. `cancelSubscription` keeps the same structural
    signature.

    Two read-then-write windows in the tenant's own writes are closed in **both**
    adapters: an ordinary cancellation no longer restates the status it read a
    moment earlier — a trial going live in between came back as `TRIAL`,
    entitlements and all — and an immediate plan change now locks the row its
    decisions come from.

    One reading changes as a consequence: a `publishedChanges` column holding
    something other than an array now reads as `null` in the plan-catalogue
    projections rather than being cast, which is what the other mappers already did.

- 2e98fae: Drizzle learns about bundles

    `@saasicat/adapter-drizzle` had no bundle persistence at all — not three missing
    columns, but zero bundle tables and zero bundle repositories. A consumer on
    Drizzle could not sell an add-on, and the persistence contract skipped both
    bundle scenarios by capability rather than failing them, so the gap was visible
    but never closed.

    Both halves are now implemented. `DrizzleBundleRepository` is the catalogue —
    what may be sold, in which versions, and from when — with the same opt-in
    validity windows `adapter-prisma` has: with them on, publishing closes the
    predecessor's window the day before the successor opens, and
    `findActiveBundleVersion` answers which version is bookable at a moment; with
    them off the method is not offered rather than answering from columns the
    adapter does not maintain. `DrizzleSubscriptionBundleRepository` is the booking
    junction, carrying the rhythm and the window a bundle is billed for.

    Both are registered in the persistence bundle, and the two contract scenarios
    that used to skip now run against real PostgreSQL for this adapter as well.

### Minor Changes

- a56af36: A term is a term: minimum term, notice period, and when a change lands

    The rules a subscription runs by were partly implicit and partly in the wrong
    layer. This makes them explicit and puts each one where it can be read.

    **An immediate change may improve the service; it may not shorten the
    commitment.** `changeType` collapsed "a better plan" and "a shorter period" into
    one word, so moving from a yearly STARTER to a monthly PRO classified as
    `UPGRADE`, applied immediately, and ended the yearly commitment early. Plan
    direction and cycle direction are two answers now (`planDirection`,
    `cycleDirection` on the preview), and only an upgrade that does not shorten the
    cycle takes effect today. A trial is the exception, because it commits to
    nothing: its cycle says how it will be billed once it converts, not a period the
    customer is inside, so an upgrade during a trial takes effect at once whichever
    cycle it picks.

    **A cancellation is a declaration; when it lands is decided, not asked for.**
    `POST /billing/cancel` no longer accepts `immediately` — a tenant could use it to
    end a term they were inside. The date comes from the minimum term and the
    configured notice period. `useTenantBilling().cancelSubscription()` therefore
    takes no argument and returns the dates instead.

    **`canceledAt` and `canceledEffectiveAt` are two fields.** They were one, which
    made a subscription cancelled in month three of a year look finished — it runs,
    is billed and keeps every entitlement until the term ends. `Subscription` gains
    `minimumTermUntil` and `canceledEffectiveAt`; the renewal reads the second, so a
    declared cancellation no longer stops a period from rolling and a landed one
    does.

    **A notice period is configurable and zero by default.** `cancellationNoticeDays`
    on the billing module. With no window there is no door to be shut out of; where
    one is configured the cut is hard, and a declaration made after it lands at the
    end of the _following_ period.

    **A trial has an end, not a term.** A trial carries a period end like any other
    subscription, and reading it as a commitment made the two rules a customer meets
    disagree: a plan change during a trial applies at once because there is nothing
    to protect, while a cancellation was measured against a term that does not
    exist. With a notice period configured that was not a difference of weeks — a
    trial ending inside the window is already past its deadline, so cancelling a
    yearly-cycle trial bought a year. A trial's cancellation now lands when the
    trial does, and no notice window applies to it.

    **A prorated upgrade never asks for less than nothing.** The formula is
    unchanged — `(target − current) × remaining ÷ period` — and its result is now
    floored at zero, with `rawDeltaNet` and `isFree` beside it so a page can say
    "free upgrade" rather than showing a credit this platform does not pay. `isFree`
    is strictly negative: a change that costs exactly zero, because the two plans
    are priced the same, is not a free upgrade but a change with no price
    difference, and those are two different sentences to somebody deciding.

    **The tenant sees what happens and when.** Three changes arrive later than a
    reader expects — an upgrade with a shortened cycle, a downgrade, a cycle change
    — and each is acknowledged rather than announced: the consequence is the
    heading, the date is in bold, and the confirmation stays locked until it is
    ticked. A downgrade lists the features it costs. A cancelled subscription shows
    its end date instead of the word "cancelled".

    **The timing never travels from the client.** `POST /billing/plan` no longer
    accepts `effectiveImmediately`, and `useTenantBilling().changePlan()` no longer
    takes it: the route derives the timing from the same preview the wizard renders.
    It used to branch on the flag under a comment promising the server-side check
    "prevents bypass via a direct API call" — it checked the blockers and left the
    one decision that carries money to the caller.

    **A period boundary on a month end stays on a month end.** `advanceOneCycle`
    overflowed: 31 January plus a month was 3 March, and 29 February plus a year was
    1 March. Pre-existing, invisible while the result was only a period boundary,
    and reported to a customer as a contract end date now.

    **Cancelling twice does not move the date.** A repeat returns the existing
    cancellation and writes nothing. With a notice period configured, recomputing it
    against a later `now` could land it a whole period further out — an on-time
    declaration landing January 2027, retried after the deadline, became January 2028.

    **The date the page showed is the date that applies.** `POST /billing/cancel`
    accepts an optional `expectedEffectiveAt` and refuses with
    `CANCELLATION_TERMS_CHANGED` when its own answer differs, so a dialog opened
    before a notice deadline and confirmed after it cannot deliver a date the
    customer never saw. Where the answer _is_ the moment of asking — a subscription
    with nothing left to run — the check accepts any reading of the clock up to now
    and refuses only a date still in the future; comparing those two readings for
    equality would refuse every confirmation, including each retry.

    **A cancellation written before the fields split is still a cancellation.**
    `GET /billing/usage` applies the same fallback the renewal and the cancel route
    apply, so a row whose effective date sits in `canceledAt` reports it. Read
    strictly, it told the page nothing had been cancelled — which hid the end date
    and went on offering to cancel it again.

    **Both enforcement paths see the end, and a cached answer does not outlive
    it.** Entitlements are enforced along two paths, and a rule written in one is
    enforced in half the applications: `StaticFeatureGuard` and
    `EnforceQuotaInterceptor` — what an app gets without registering tenant billing
    — reach their plan through `SubscriptionPlanResolver`, which asked only whether
    the status was `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL`. It reads the cancellation too now, and takes
    the same `canceledEntitlementPlan` floor, because two paths that disagree about
    what a cancelled subscription keeps would be worse than either answer alone. And
    a cached limits entry is capped at the cancellation's effective moment: every
    other thing that changes those limits is a mutation and invalidates the cache,
    while a date arriving is not, so the old features were served for up to a minute
    past the end of the contract.

    **A cancellation that has taken effect ends the entitlements.** It did not.
    Nothing on the entitlement path read a cancellation, so a subscription that
    ended last January was granted exactly what it was granted while active — same
    plan, same features, same quotas, and `FeatureGuard` let it through. The root
    was that `SubscriptionRecord`, the record that path reads, carried neither date;
    it now requires both, so an adapter cannot omit them silently. A landed
    cancellation grants nothing by default, and `canceledEntitlementPlan` on
    `EntitlementResolutionConfig` names a floor for installations that want one — a
    read-only tier to export from, a free plan to fall back to. A cancellation that
    is merely declared still changes nothing, which is the same rule as before.
    `@saasicat/adapter-drizzle` gained the two columns in its query map to supply
    them. **This removes access from tenants whose cancellation has already landed**;
    [the upgrade guide](https://github.com/uelker70/saasicat/blob/main/docs/guides/upgrade-to-1.0.md)
    carries the query that lists
    them.

    **Nothing rolls onto a subscription whose term is over.** A plan _version_
    published before the customer cancelled still comes due afterwards, and the
    renewal decision read only the version's own dates — so it rewrote the plan of a
    subscription that had ended. `decideRenewal` reads the cancellation now, the way
    `computeNextPeriod` beside it already did, and `RenewalSubInput` carries the two
    dates for it. The tenant route that accepts a pending version refuses the same
    case, and the page stops offering the banner that leads to it.

    **The page tells an ended subscription from a cancelled one.** Nothing
    transitions the status column when a cancellation lands, so a subscription that
    ended last month still reads `ACTIVE` there. The tenant plan card believed it: a
    positive badge, a next billing date, and a sentence promising nothing would
    change before a date already in the past — beside a "change plan" button whose
    route now refuses. It reads the date instead, shows the subscription as ended,
    and offers neither act. A cancellation still to come is unaffected and says so:
    that subscription runs, is billed and keeps everything until the date.

    **A repeated cancellation no longer explains itself with a date it cannot
    know.** The repeat reports what is stored — that it was already cancelled, and
    when it lands. `termEndsAt`, `noticeDeadline` and `afterNoticeDeadline` are null
    there, because the decision behind them was taken once against a `now` that has
    passed; deriving them from the effective date reported a declaration that landed
    a period late as an on-time one. `CancellationResultShape.afterNoticeDeadline`
    is therefore `boolean | null`.

    **The till closes with the subscription, and the ledger stays open.** A bundle
    is bought, priced and given a minimum term of its own, and it grants its
    features through the parent — which grants nothing once its cancellation has
    landed. Booking, pricing a purchase and reactivating are refused there;
    listing, cancelling and pricing a cancellation stay open, because a tenant who
    has left still has bookings to recognise and invoices to explain.

    **A bundle cannot commit past the subscription that pays for it.** A twelve-month
    default term on a subscription ending in three weeks binds a customer to
    something with three weeks left to give, and once the parent ends the booking
    grants nothing. The term is clamped to the parent's end rather than the purchase
    refused: somebody who cancelled for the end of the month may still want a bundle
    for this month, and a bundle is priced per period rather than per term, so a
    shorter commitment cannot overcharge them. `addBundleToSubscription` takes
    `parentEndsAt`.

    **A frozen contract ends when the subscription does.** Left active, it outlived
    the agreement it froze: entitlement resolution granted nothing while
    `getActiveInvoiceSnapshotForTenant()` went on reporting a live contract — two
    answers to "is this customer under contract", and the one that bills said yes.
    Every later freeze carries the ending too: a plan change on a cancelled
    subscription is allowed, and each one supersedes the contract with a fresh one —
    uncapped, that successor lost the ending and the repair held exactly until the
    next change. `freezeOnPlanChange` takes `endsAt`. And a cancellation that was
    already recorded repairs its contract on the next attempt, because only the
    request that wins the cancellation write reaches the hook: a row written before
    this existed, or a retry after the non-fatal contract call failed, would
    otherwise never be capped at all.

    `ContractFreezePort` gains `endOnCancellation`, and the cancel route calls it
    with the same effective date, non-fatally as every other use of that port. It
    ends the contract _by date_: `TerminateSubscriptionContractData.status` accepts
    null, and the active lookup is already a window, so a cancellation declared
    months ahead leaves the agreement findable until it lands. Writing a terminal
    status there would be the opposite mistake and the worse one — the customer is
    still under contract, still paying, and it would have vanished from every lookup
    the moment they declared.

    **Onboarding is a first activation, and a contract that is over is not one.**
    The route refuses a subscription whose cancellation has landed, and its write —
    the atomic one, which is the path a real adapter takes — claims the row against
    the cancellation the route read, exactly as the plan change does. Both halves
    were missing: the guard lived on the plan route only, and the claim had been
    added to the sequential fallback while the preferred path updated
    unconditionally. `ApplyOnboardingSelectionInput` carries `expectedCanceledAt`
    and the result answers `claimed`.

    **A plan change decided against one state is not written into another.** The
    route reads the subscription, computes a preview and decides three things from
    the cancellation — whether the change is refused, whether the cycle may move,
    whether a fresh period is opened — and only then writes. A cancellation arriving
    in that window made all three answers about a state that no longer existed, and
    the write went ahead: a plan term recorded past the date the subscription ends.
    `ImmediatePlanChangeInput` and `ScheduledPlanChangeInput` carry
    `expectedCanceledAt`, both writes claim the row only while that still holds, and
    a lost claim answers `SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGED` instead of overwriting. The boundary
    itself is re-read immediately before the write: the claim compares `canceledAt`,
    which a passing minute does not change, so a cancellation recorded earlier and
    landing while the preview was computed would have satisfied it.

    **The preview says what the write will refuse.** A cancelled subscription
    cannot change its billing cycle, and until now only the write said so — a reader
    picked the cycle, read the consequence, ticked the acknowledgement and met a 409
    on confirm. The preview carries the restriction as a blocker, which is what the
    wizard reads before it lets anyone past the first step.

    **A subscription that has ended is not an active tenant.** Both adapters counted
    by status alone, and a landed cancellation leaves the status at `ACTIVE` — so a
    plan's tenant count in the SuperAdmin UI carried every customer who had ever
    left, and grew for ever.

    **A cancellation is declared once, even when it is declared twice at once.**
    The route checks whether one exists and then writes, and those are two moments:
    two requests could pass the check before either wrote. Either side of a notice
    deadline that costs a billing cycle, the second write replaced an on-time date
    with one a period later. The write is a conditional claim now — one statement,
    `canceledAt` and `canceledEffectiveAt` both still empty — and a declaration that
    loses it reads back what the winner wrote. `TenantSubscriptionWritePort` answers
    `alreadyCanceled` for that.

    **A cancelled subscription cannot change its billing cycle.** The cancellation
    was measured against the term of the cycle it was declared under. A monthly
    subscription ending on the 1st, upgraded to a yearly plan, is an immediate
    change — the plan goes up, the cycle gets longer — and it produced a contract
    that contradicted itself: `YEARLY` beside the monthly period the cancellation
    closes, with a year's price prorated across the days left in it. The route
    answers `CANCELLATION_LOCKS_THE_CYCLE`; the plan may still move on the cycle it
    was sold in.

    **The tenant page follows the boundary instead of the last render.** Whether a
    subscription has ended is a question about the clock, and a clock read inside a
    computed is not a dependency of it — a card left open across the effective
    moment kept saying "runs unchanged" and kept offering a plan change the route
    refuses. The moment is scheduled now, in hops below the platform's timer limit,
    and the timer is cleared with the component.

    **A cancellation is a boundary, and two writes used to cross it.** A plan change
    and a cancellation are two decisions about one subscription, and neither could
    see the other. A subscription that had already ended still accepted an
    upgrade — applied, prorated and charged — while entitlement resolution granted
    nothing, because it reads the cancellation and the route did not; that route now
    answers `SUBSCRIPTION_ENDED`. An immediate change on a subscription that is
    cancelled but still running no longer opens a fresh billing period, which would
    have sold a term the cancellation cuts short. And a change scheduled before the
    customer cancelled is declined once the cancellation has landed, instead of
    restarting the period and running the follow-up hooks on a term that is over —
    `DuePendingPlanChange` carries the two dates for that decision. A cancellation
    that has _not_ landed declines nothing: a customer who bought a further period
    by cancelling late may still choose the plan they spend it on.

    **A cancellation writes what it decided, not only when it lands.** Two things
    follow from the date and neither is asked for. A subscription with nothing left
    to run — a trial, or one still waiting for sales, with no period end and no
    committed term — is now recorded as ended rather than left `ACTIVE` for good:
    nothing downstream would ever have transitioned it. What entitlements a
    cancelled subscription grants is unchanged and still under review. And a
    declaration made after the notice window closed
    extends the stored commitment to the period it bought, because every other
    reader of the term end looks at `minimumTermUntil` — a downgrade scheduled
    meanwhile would otherwise have landed at the old term end, inside the period the
    customer had just paid for.

    **Breaking for anyone implementing the ports.** `changePlanImmediate` and
    `schedulePlanChange` take `expectedCanceledAt` and answer `claimed`; both must
    claim conditionally rather than update, or the race above stays open in that
    adapter. `SubscriptionRecord`, `SubscriptionUsageRecord`, `DuePendingPlanChange`
    and `RenewalSubInput` require `canceledAt` and `canceledEffectiveAt` — required rather than optional because
    an adapter that omits them cannot tell a subscription that ends next January
    from one that ended last January, and the silent answer is the wrong one.
    `TenantSubscriptionWritePort.cancelSubscription` now takes
    `{ canceledAt, effectiveAt, terminateNow, minimumTermUntil? }` and returns
    `canceledEffectiveAt`;
    it used to compute the effective date itself from a boolean, which put a
    commercial decision in a persistence adapter where neither the term nor the
    notice period is visible. `SubscriptionUsageRecord` gains three optional fields,
    and `GET /billing/usage` answers with `cancellation` — what cancelling right now
    would do, so a page can state the date before the customer confirms.

### Patch Changes

- ed230d3: Every package README now answers the same three questions in the same order:
  what this is, what this is **not**, and where to go next.

    The middle one is the addition. `@saasicat/core` is not a types-only package,
    `@saasicat/spec` does not run your migrations, `@saasicat/cli` has no binary of
    its own for the flows it ships, and `@saasicat/ui-vue-tenant` renders in your
    application rather than in the admin — each of those was a question rather than
    a sentence.

    `@saasicat/nest` and `@saasicat/ui-vue` list all twelve and thirteen of their
    entry points with what is in each and when to take it; the previous tables
    covered one and four. A repository test checks those tables against the export
    map in both directions.

### Patch Changes

- 3ebc363: **`saasicat schema apply` now appends the enums a fragment declares, above the models that use
  them.** It used to copy models only, so a fresh schema ended up with `Subscription.billingCycle`
  and no `BillingCycle` — twenty Prisma validation errors at quickstart step 3 for anyone who had
  not pasted the enums in by hand. An enum the schema already declares is left untouched, as models
  are. Found by installing the 1.0 candidate from npm into an empty project; the example app had
  carried the enums since before the command existed, so nothing in the repository saw the gap.

    **Every package with an exports map now exports `./package.json`.** Seven did not, and a bundler
    plugin, `vue-tsc` or pnpm reading the manifest got `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.
    **`saasicat init` names two more things the generated wiring needs.** The `forRoot` block now
    carries `imports: [YourPrismaModule, YourAuthModule]` the way it carries `YourAuthGuard` — it does
    not compile until you name them — because `prismaPersistence({ client: PrismaService })` is
    resolved inside the platform module, which sees only what that list holds or what is `@Global`.
    Left out, the generated app compiled and stopped on its first boot with "Nest can't resolve
    dependencies of … (PrismaService)". And `init` now refuses a `tsconfig.json` whose
    `moduleResolution` is `node`: the files it writes import subpath exports, which only `node16`,
    `nodenext` or `bundler` resolve. The quickstart says so too.

    **`create-saasicat-admin` scaffolds an app that type-checks.** Its `platform-loaders.ts` still
    passed `getAuthToken` to `createPlatformLoaders`, an option the 1.0 line no longer has, so every
    fresh admin failed `vue-tsc` on its first run. The scaffolder's tests now type-check a scaffolded
    app against the `@saasicat/ui-vue` it was scaffolded for.

### Major Changes

- 9449492: **One name for everything — and a codemod that applies it.** Phase 5 of the 1.0 cut.

    `npx @saasicat/cli@latest codemod v1 --dir=.` does the surface cut from the previous
    candidates and everything below in one run. `docs/migrating-to-1.0.md` is the written
    form, with before/after for each change.

    **`SaasPlatformModule` is gone; `SaaSiCatModule` is the class**, not an alias of it.
    The thirteen `SaasPlatform*` option types are `SaaSiCat*` — `SaaSiCatModuleOptions`,
    `SaaSiCatAdapters`, `SaaSiCatCatalogOptions` and so on. `createSaasPlatformTestModule`
    is `createSaaSiCatTestModule`; `SaasicatPersistenceAdapter` and its six slice types are
    `SaaSiCatPersistenceAdapter` and `SaaSiCatPersistence*`. There is one spelling of the
    product name left: `SaaSiCat` in types and prose, `saasicat` in packages and files,
    `SAASICAT_` in constants.

    **Every registry key is `saasicat/<package>/<Name>`.** Four prefixes —
    `saas-platform/`, `saas-platform-nest/`, `saas-platform-cli/`, and `@saasicat/ui-vue/` for
    the Vue injection keys — became one. This matters only if your code calls `Symbol.for`
    with one of those strings itself; the exported token constants are unchanged in name and
    resolve as before. The keys will not be renamed again: the rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md` says
    why, and a repository test refuses any other prefix.

    **`FEATURE_UI_REGISTRY_TOKEN` has two names now**, because it meant two registries:
    `BILLING_FEATURE_UI_REGISTRY_TOKEN` from `@saasicat/nest/billing` and
    `CATALOG_FEATURE_UI_REGISTRY_TOKEN` from `@saasicat/nest/catalog`. The codemod picks by
    the entry you imported from and reports an import it cannot decide.

    **`@saasicat/ui-vue/testing-e2e/*` is `@saasicat/ui-vue/testing/*`** — the Playwright
    helper consumers run their admin pages through. Nothing else about it changed.

    Inside the repository, for anyone who reads it: the package directories are the package
    names (`packages/nest`, not `packages/saas-platform-nest`), Nest files follow
    `<area>/<name>.module.ts`, adapter files end in `.repository.ts` or `.adapter.ts`, and test
    directories are `tests/{integration,component,e2e}`. None of that reaches a consumer's
    imports.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9449492]
    - @saasicat/types@1.0.0-rc.0

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 40e270c: **The license changes from Apache-2.0 to PolyForm Shield 1.0.0.** SaaSiCat is
  source-available from this release on, not OSI open source.

    What stays permitted, and it is nearly everything: reading the code, running it,
    changing it, redistributing it, and building and selling your own SaaS product on
    top of it. What is not permitted is offering a product that competes with
    SaaSiCat itself, or with a product its author provides using it. There is no time
    limit and no reversion to a permissive license.

    **Versions up to and including 0.26.1 remain Apache-2.0.** Rights granted with a
    published version cannot be withdrawn, and npm versions are immutable — if you
    depend on 0.26.1 or earlier, nothing about your terms changes until you upgrade.

    Practically: if you use SaaSiCat to build an application, this changes nothing
    for you. If you were planning to repackage SaaSiCat itself as a product, it does.

    The reasoning, the alternatives that were weighed, and the consequences are in
    [ADR 0001](https://github.com/uelker70/saasicat/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-source-available-licensing.md).

### Minor Changes

- 9cf68f6: New package: the Drizzle + PostgreSQL persistence adapter — the proof that SaaSicat's ports are ORM-agnostic in practice, not just on paper.

    - `drizzlePersistence({ db })` bundle for `SaasPlatformModule.forRoot({ persistence })`, mirroring `prismaPersistence()` slice by slice (core incl. transaction runner and audit write/query/stats, entitlement with row-locked `findByTenantIdLocked`, promo repositories with atomic `claimSlot`/`releaseSlot`/`markExhaustedIfFull` as guarded UPDATE … RETURNING, SuperAdmin bootstrap, plan-catalog read/import sinks).
    - Driver-independent: typed against `PgDatabase` from `drizzle-orm/pg-core`, so node-postgres and postgres.js clients both work; row counts come from RETURNING instead of driver-specific result shapes.
    - Targets the same canonical schema (`@saasicat/spec` reference SQL) as adapter-prisma — ids and `updatedAt` are generated app-side to match Prisma's client-side behavior, enum columns are declared as text and coerced by Postgres.
    - Passes the identical `@saasicat/persistence-testing` contract against a real PostgreSQL (CI runs both adapters in the persistence-contract job), plus drizzle-specific interop tests for enum round-trips and the subscription CHECK constraint.
