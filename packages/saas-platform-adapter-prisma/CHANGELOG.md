- 30ec6c6: Make the plan-catalog snapshot deterministic, and close two gaps in the
  shared-CJS-bundle work.

    - `PrismaPlanCatalogReadSink` ordered plans and feature entries by `sortOrder`
      alone — not a total order, so rows sharing a value came back in whatever
      order Postgres picked, and the live plan-version query had no ordering at
      all. The snapshot feeds the admin-manifest hash, so two processes reading
      identical data disagreed on the hash: `GET /admin/manifest` and a CLI
      `manifest hash` could never be compared. All three queries now carry a
      deterministic tiebreaker.
    - The public entry list is derived from `package.json` `exports` instead of
      being repeated in the tsup config, the stub generator and the identity test.
      A new entry that was added to only some of those copies kept its own
      duplicated CJS bundle — silently reintroducing the split class identities the
      shared bundle exists to prevent. The build now fails with an actionable
      message instead.
    - `globalFeatureGuard`'s documentation named the wrong class. The option
      unbinds `StaticFeatureGuard`, not `FeatureGuard` — they are different
      classes backed by different entitlement paths — and neither the JSDoc nor
      the migration guide said that a replacement guard MUST be bound. An app
      following the old wording would have left every `@RequireFeature` route
      serving unlicensed traffic.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 7145f07: Make the CommonJS entry points share one set of objects, and open the seams a
  consumer app needs when its shape does not match the standard stack's defaults.
  Each of these was previously unreachable, so an app that hit one had to abandon
  `SaaSiCatModule` entirely rather than configure around it.

    - **The CJS build now emits one shared bundle** (`dist/_entries.cjs`) with a
      thin re-export per entry, instead of a separate bundle per entry. esbuild
      cannot code-split CommonJS, so every shared module used to be copied into each
      entry — and since Nest resolves providers by class reference, two copies of a
      class are two different providers. Composing `SaaSiCatModule` (from
      `./platform`) with `SetupModule` (from the root entry) failed at boot with
      "MfaService is not available in the SetupModule module". ESM was already
      code-split and unaffected. Consumers no longer need to know which entry a
      class "really" comes from.
    - Exported DI tokens that were still plain `Symbol()` are now `Symbol.for`,
      per the rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md` — 42 of them, including
      `ADMIN_MANIFEST_CONFIG`. The catalog and billing `FEATURE_UI_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
      stay deliberately distinct and are now namespaced apart rather than colliding
      by accident.
    - `@saasicat/nest/platform` additionally re-exports the modules and services an
      app composes alongside `SaaSiCatModule` (`AdminModule`, `AdminManifestModule`,
      `AdminStatsModule`, `SetupModule`, `CheckoutOfferModule`,
      `SubscriptionContractModule` and their services), so the standard stack can be
      assembled from a single import path.
    - New `globalFeatureGuard` option. The module bound `StaticFeatureGuard` as a
      global `APP_GUARD` unconditionally. Nest runs every global guard before every
      controller-local one, so apps that authenticate in a controller-local guard
      got a 403 on all feature-gated routes before authentication had run. Set
      `false` to bind the guard behind your own auth guard instead. The quota
      interceptor stays global either way — interceptors run after all guards.
    - `includeManifestController` is now passed through to `AdminManifestModule`.
      Apps serving `GET /admin/manifest` from their own controller could not
      suppress the platform one, and two controllers on one path abort the boot with
      a duplicate-route error.
    - `prismaPersistence()` accepts a `bundle` option forwarded to both bundle
      repositories it builds. Because the bundle constructs them directly rather
      than through Nest DI, the repository's `@Optional()` options provider never
      applied, leaving `validityWindows` unreachable — bundle publishes then
      silently dropped `validFrom`.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- b30a110: Add a high-level SaaSiCat standard stack that wires catalog, entitlements,
  tenant billing and subscription bundles from one persistence bundle. The
  Prisma bundle now includes the canonical catalog and tenant-billing adapters,
  including a reusable subscription usage mapper and standard Admin resource
  adapter. Tenant, user, audit and subscription controllers plus promo-code CRUD
  can now be enabled with two flags. The Vue client supplies the matching
  resource loaders and actions. Existing fine-grained modules and adapter
  overrides remain available.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 05729ce: Add explicit, backwards-compatible Prisma schema profiles for semantic
  plan-key and normalized Plan UUID bindings, configurable catalog and
  entitlement delegates, opt-in PlanVersion and BundleVersion validity windows,
  and atomic tenant plan/PlanVersion writes including onboarding rollback.
  Atomic onboarding is exposed only through an explicit schema opt-in; pending
  PlanVersion acceptance now uses a compare-and-set guard, and active-version
  selection consistently puts legacy null validity dates last.
  Opt-in SubscriptionBundle booking counts let the shared subscription adapter
  preserve BundleVersion editability without requiring the junction table.
  Active subscription counts now derive their authoritative plan identity from
  PlanVersion and Plan, stay scoped to the requested project, and ignore drifted
  denormalized Subscription plan values. The configured
  `tenantSubscription.delegate` is now honored by every subscription ORM
  operation, including transactional reads; locked reads retain the canonical
  physical `subscriptions` table contract.

    Extend the executable persistence contract with semantic identity,
    plan-binding, validity-window, auto-succession, and transactional promo
    redemption rollback scenarios. Catalog lifecycle scenarios now take their
    project identity from the required contract `projectKey` option.

    Run the optional contract freeze after every successful onboarding plan
    change, regardless of whether the adapter uses atomic onboarding or the
    legacy sequential fallback.

### Minor Changes

- 98274fe: Ship the catalog-plane Prisma repositories so a consumer can wire the full
  SuperAdmin surface without hand-writing adapters.

    `@saasicat/adapter-prisma` previously covered only the core/entitlement/promo
    slices; every app that wanted the plans/bundles/discovery-review/
    marketing pages had to implement ~2000 lines of catalog repositories itself. The
    package now exports them:

    - `PrismaPlanRepository` (`PlanRepository`)
    - `PrismaBundleRepository` (`BundleRepository`)
    - `PrismaCatalogEntryRepository` (`CatalogEntryRepository`)
    - `PrismaMarketingProjectionRepository` (`MarketingProjectionRepository`)
    - `PrismaMarketingSettingsRepository` (`MarketingSettingsRepository`)
    - `PrismaPromotionRepository` (`PromotionRepository`)
    - `PrismaSubscriptionContractRepository` (`SubscriptionContractRepository`)

    Wire them into `CatalogModule.forRoot({ planRepository: { useFactory: (p) => new
PrismaPlanRepository(p), inject: [PrismaService] }, … })`. Each targets the
    canonical `@saasicat/spec` schema; the generic `PrismaModelDelegateLike<Row>`
    helper is also exported for adapters that need a narrow client view.

    Methods that depend on columns the canonical fragments do not carry
    (`PlanVersion`/`BundleVersion` validity windows, plan `terminate`) throw a
    descriptive error rather than silently misbehaving — the same fail-closed policy
    the shipped `PrismaSubscriptionRepository` already uses.

    **`@saasicat/spec`:** the `QuotaCatalogEntry` fragment (06) gained `replaces
String[]` and `successorKey String?`, aligning it with the
    `QuotaCatalogEntryRow` / `UpsertQuotaEntryData` port contract (features already
    had them) so the discovery sync can persist quota succession. The generated
    `sql/reference-schema.postgres.sql` is regenerated to match.

- 0c08fc3: Remove the BusinessType catalog concept across the public contracts, NestJS
  modules, persistence adapters, UI, OpenAPI specification, and canonical database
  schema. Subscriptions now always reference a plan version; bundles remain the
  only composable catalog add-on.

### Minor Changes

- d758318: PostgreSQL-first, ORM-agnostic persistence: ship the complete Prisma golden path and make its semantics verifiable.

    - **`@saasicat/adapter-prisma`** (renamed from `@saasicat/prisma`, which is now deprecated): ships every previously missing adapter — `PrismaTransactionRunner`, `PrismaSubscriptionRepository` (row-locked `findByTenantIdLocked`), `PrismaPlanVersionRepository`, the three promo repositories with atomic `claimSlot`/`releaseSlot`/`markExhaustedIfFull`, `PrismaAuditAdapter` (now targeting the canonical `audit_logs` table incl. `actorTag`), `PrismaAuditQueryAdapter`, `PrismaAuditStatsAdapter`, `PrismaSuperAdminBootstrapAdapter`, `PrismaPlanCatalogReadSink`/`ImportSink` — plus the new `prismaPersistence({ client })` bundle factory.
    - **`@saasicat/types`**: new persistence bundle contract — `SaasicatPersistenceAdapter` with core/entitlement/promo slices, `PersistenceCapabilities` + `assertPersistenceCapabilities` (fail-fast `PersistenceCapabilityError`), `PersistenceProvider<T>`; `PasswordHasher` moved here from `@saasicat/nest/registration` (re-exported there).
    - **`@saasicat/nest`**: `SaasPlatformModule.forRoot({ persistence })` consumes adapter bundles (individual `adapters` entries still override field by field) and refuses to boot entitlement without transactions + pessimistic locking.
    - **`@saasicat/persistence-testing`** (new): the executable persistence contract — one node:test suite every adapter must pass against a real database (row-lock serialization, transaction rollback, exactly-once promo claims, unique redemption guard, tenant isolation, audit/MFA roundtrips). CI runs it for adapter-prisma against PostgreSQL 16.
    - **`@saasicat/spec`**: the data model is now normatively anchored in `docs/data-model.md` + `sql/constraints.postgres.sql`, with `sql/reference-schema.postgres.sql` generated from the prisma-fragments (drift-guarded in CI). Fragment fixes: `AuditLog.actorTag` column, new fragment `10-super-admin.prisma`, `FeatureCatalogEntry.core/requires/replaces/successorKey`, missing `BusinessTypeVersion↔Subscription` opposite relation.
