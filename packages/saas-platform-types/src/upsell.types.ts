// Upsell response of the FeatureGuard (#36) — wire format + resolver port.
//
// When the FeatureGuard throws due to a missing entitlement, the frontend
// should be able to turn that into a purchase offer instead of just showing
// "access denied". For that the guard returns a structured 403 body
// (`FeatureNotLicensedBody`); the offers come from an optionally
// registered `UpsellOfferResolver`.
//
// Status-code decision: **403 with a `code` field**, NOT 402.
// - 402 "Payment Required" is reserved/experimental in the HTTP standard;
//   proxies, HTTP clients and error interceptors handle it
//   inconsistently.
// - 403 matches the semantics exactly: authenticated, but not authorized
//   (license missing). SPA interceptors that only auto-logout on 401
//   are unaffected (cf. the DMS 401 trap) — consumer interceptors
//   must never interpret a 403 as an auth error.
// - The machine distinction runs via `code === 'FEATURE_NOT_LICENSED'`,
//   not via the status code.
