### Minor Changes

- c94b1fe: Remove `quotaKeys` from `saas.yaml` — quota keys now have a single source of truth: the `@DefinesQuota` decorator in code, validated against the discovery snapshot.

    **Breaking:** `saas.yaml` files containing a `quotaKeys:` block fail schema validation (`additionalProperties: false`). Delete the block — the platform derives all quota dimensions from the registered `QuotaProvider` classes.

    - `plan-catalog.schema.json` / `admin-manifest.schema.json` / OpenAPI: `quotaKeys` removed from schema and `planCatalogSnapshot`.
    - `PlanCatalog.quotaKeys`, `PlanCatalogModule.forRoot({ quotaKeys })` and `buildPlanCatalogFromSnapshot` settings field removed.
    - `PlanChangePreviewService.limitsCheck` and `GET /billing/usage` iterate the union of quota keys from entitlement, target plan and usage snapshot instead of the catalog list.
    - `TenantBillingController` no longer injects the plan catalog.
    - `TenantPlanSection` derives the displayed quota keys as an ordered union across all plans and the tenant's effective limits (previously only the first plan's keys), so higher-tier-only quotas stay visible.

### Patch Changes

- db10ab9: Fix scaffolded projects pinning a platform version that never gets published.

    `templates/package.json.tpl` hardcoded `@saasicat/types` and `@saasicat/ui-vue` at `^0.1.0`. Because caret pins the minor for `0.x` versions, `^0.1.0` resolves to `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0` and would not match the published `0.2.0` — every scaffolded project would fail to install. The template now uses a `__PLATFORM_VERSION__` token that the scaffolder fills from its own `package.json` version, so the pin tracks each lockstep release automatically.

    Also: ship `cli-conventions.md` in `@saasicat/spec` (the `@saasicat/cli` README links to it), point package README links at absolute GitHub URLs so they resolve on npm, and translate the scaffolder's CLI output to English.
