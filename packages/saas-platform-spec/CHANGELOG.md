# @saasicat/spec

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 05729ce: Add explicit, backwards-compatible Prisma schema profiles for semantic
  plan-key and normalized Plan UUID bindings, configurable catalog and
  entitlement delegates, opt-in PlanVersion and BundleVersion validity windows,
  and atomic tenant plan/PlanVersion writes including onboarding rollback.
  Atomic onboarding is exposed only through an explicit schema opt-in; pending
  PlanVersion acceptance now uses a compare-and-set guard, and active-version
  selection consistently puts legacy null validity dates last.
  Opt-in SubscriptionBundle booking counts let the shared subscription adapter
  preserve BundleVersion editability without requiring the junction table.
  Active subscription counts now derive their authoritative plan identity from
  PlanVersion and Plan, stay scoped to the requested project, and ignore drifted
  denormalized Subscription plan values. The configured
  `tenantSubscription.delegate` is now honored by every subscription ORM
  operation, including transactional reads; locked reads retain the canonical
  physical `subscriptions` table contract.

    Extend the executable persistence contract with semantic identity,
    plan-binding, validity-window, auto-succession, and transactional promo
    redemption rollback scenarios. Catalog lifecycle scenarios now take their
    project identity from the required contract `projectKey` option.

    Run the optional contract freeze after every successful onboarding plan
    change, regardless of whether the adapter uses atomic onboarding or the
    legacy sequential fallback.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0c08fc3: Remove the BusinessType catalog concept across the public contracts, NestJS
  modules, persistence adapters, UI, OpenAPI specification, and canonical database
  schema. Subscriptions now always reference a plan version; bundles remain the
  only composable catalog add-on.

### Patch Changes

- 98274fe: Ship the catalog-plane Prisma repositories so a consumer can wire the full
  SuperAdmin surface without hand-writing adapters.

    `@saasicat/adapter-prisma` previously covered only the core/entitlement/promo
    slices; every app that wanted the plans/bundles/discovery-review/
    marketing pages had to implement ~2000 lines of catalog repositories itself. The
    package now exports them:

    - `PrismaPlanRepository` (`PlanRepository`)
    - `PrismaBundleRepository` (`BundleRepository`)
    - `PrismaCatalogEntryRepository` (`CatalogEntryRepository`)
    - `PrismaMarketingProjectionRepository` (`MarketingProjectionRepository`)
    - `PrismaMarketingSettingsRepository` (`MarketingSettingsRepository`)
    - `PrismaPromotionRepository` (`PromotionRepository`)
    - `PrismaSubscriptionContractRepository` (`SubscriptionContractRepository`)

    Wire them into `CatalogModule.forRoot({ planRepository: { useFactory: (p) => new
PrismaPlanRepository(p), inject: [PrismaService] }, … })`. Each targets the
    canonical `@saasicat/spec` schema; the generic `PrismaModelDelegateLike<Row>`
    helper is also exported for adapters that need a narrow client view.

    Methods that depend on columns the canonical fragments do not carry
    (`PlanVersion`/`BundleVersion` validity windows, plan `terminate`) throw a
    descriptive error rather than silently misbehaving — the same fail-closed policy
    the shipped `PrismaSubscriptionRepository` already uses.

    **`@saasicat/spec`:** the `QuotaCatalogEntry` fragment (06) gained `replaces
String[]` and `successorKey String?`, aligning it with the
    `QuotaCatalogEntryRow` / `UpsertQuotaEntryData` port contract (features already
    had them) so the discovery sync can persist quota succession. The generated
    `sql/reference-schema.postgres.sql` is regenerated to match.

## 0.5.0

## 0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d758318: PostgreSQL-first, ORM-agnostic persistence: ship the complete Prisma golden path and make its semantics verifiable.

    - **`@saasicat/adapter-prisma`** (renamed from `@saasicat/prisma`, which is now deprecated): ships every previously missing adapter — `PrismaTransactionRunner`, `PrismaSubscriptionRepository` (row-locked `findByTenantIdLocked`), `PrismaPlanVersionRepository`, the three promo repositories with atomic `claimSlot`/`releaseSlot`/`markExhaustedIfFull`, `PrismaAuditAdapter` (now targeting the canonical `audit_logs` table incl. `actorTag`), `PrismaAuditQueryAdapter`, `PrismaAuditStatsAdapter`, `PrismaSuperAdminBootstrapAdapter`, `PrismaPlanCatalogReadSink`/`ImportSink` — plus the new `prismaPersistence({ client })` bundle factory.
    - **`@saasicat/types`**: new persistence bundle contract — `SaasicatPersistenceAdapter` with core/entitlement/promo slices, `PersistenceCapabilities` + `assertPersistenceCapabilities` (fail-fast `PersistenceCapabilityError`), `PersistenceProvider<T>`; `PasswordHasher` moved here from `@saasicat/nest/registration` (re-exported there).
    - **`@saasicat/nest`**: `SaasPlatformModule.forRoot({ persistence })` consumes adapter bundles (individual `adapters` entries still override field by field) and refuses to boot entitlement without transactions + pessimistic locking.
    - **`@saasicat/persistence-testing`** (new): the executable persistence contract — one node:test suite every adapter must pass against a real database (row-lock serialization, transaction rollback, exactly-once promo claims, unique redemption guard, tenant isolation, audit/MFA roundtrips). CI runs it for adapter-prisma against PostgreSQL 16.
    - **`@saasicat/spec`**: the data model is now normatively anchored in `docs/data-model.md` + `sql/constraints.postgres.sql`, with `sql/reference-schema.postgres.sql` generated from the prisma-fragments (drift-guarded in CI). Fragment fixes: `AuditLog.actorTag` column, new fragment `10-super-admin.prisma`, `FeatureCatalogEntry.core/requires/replaces/successorKey`, missing `BusinessTypeVersion↔Subscription` opposite relation.

## 0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c94b1fe: Remove `quotaKeys` from `saas.yaml` — quota keys now have a single source of truth: the `@DefinesQuota` decorator in code, validated against the discovery snapshot.

    **Breaking:** `saas.yaml` files containing a `quotaKeys:` block fail schema validation (`additionalProperties: false`). Delete the block — the platform derives all quota dimensions from the registered `QuotaProvider` classes.

    - `plan-catalog.schema.json` / `admin-manifest.schema.json` / OpenAPI: `quotaKeys` removed from schema and `planCatalogSnapshot`.
    - `PlanCatalog.quotaKeys`, `PlanCatalogModule.forRoot({ quotaKeys })` and `buildPlanCatalogFromSnapshot` settings field removed.
    - `PlanChangePreviewService.limitsCheck` and `GET /billing/usage` iterate the union of quota keys from entitlement, target plan and usage snapshot instead of the catalog list.
    - `TenantBillingController` no longer injects the plan catalog.
    - `TenantPlanSection` derives the displayed quota keys as an ordered union across all plans and the tenant's effective limits (previously only the first plan's keys), so higher-tier-only quotas stay visible.

### Patch Changes

- db10ab9: Fix scaffolded projects pinning a platform version that never gets published.

    `templates/package.json.tpl` hardcoded `@saasicat/types` and `@saasicat/ui-vue` at `^0.1.0`. Because caret pins the minor for `0.x` versions, `^0.1.0` resolves to `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0` and would not match the published `0.2.0` — every scaffolded project would fail to install. The template now uses a `__PLATFORM_VERSION__` token that the scaffolder fills from its own `package.json` version, so the pin tracks each lockstep release automatically.

    Also: ship `cli-conventions.md` in `@saasicat/spec` (the `@saasicat/cli` README links to it), point package README links at absolute GitHub URLs so they resolve on npm, and translate the scaffolder's CLI output to English.
