title: Cancelling
---

Cancelling is the part of a subscription a customer is most likely to dispute, so the rules are
written to be defensible rather than convenient. Two of them read backwards at first: a
cancellation may always be declared even when it cannot take effect soon, and a cancelled
subscription keeps everything until its date arrives.

### SC-CANC-001 — A cancellation may always be declared

🟢 The rules govern when it takes effect, not whether it may be made. A tenant is never told they may
not leave.

### SC-CANC-002 — A cancellation takes effect at the later of the period end and the commitment

🟢 They coincide unless a notice period has pushed one past the other.

_Source:_ #212

### SC-CANC-003 — A tenant cannot end a subscription on the spot

🟢 The tenant-facing route offers no immediate termination. Ending a contract on the spot is an
operator's act, through the operator's own path.

### SC-CANC-004 — Where nothing is left to run, the cancellation lands now, never in the past

🟢 Deferring to a period end that has already gone would report a date the reader has to reason about
backwards.

### SC-CANC-005 — There is no notice period until an installation names one

🟢 Every installation states both numbers in `config/saas.yaml`, and one that states neither does not
start. Zero is what most should write: a cancellation declared on the last day of a period then
still takes effect at the end of that period, which is the reading a customer expects and the one
that generates no disputes. It is written down rather than defaulted, because a notice period is a
commercial decision and an unwritten one is a decision nobody made.

### SC-CANC-006 — A notice period belongs to a rhythm, not to an installation

🟢 One number could not be right for both. A fortnight of notice on a yearly contract is unusual;
three months on a monthly one is void against a consumer in Germany. Each rhythm is configured
separately, and neither inherits the other — inferring one from the other would be inventing a
term. A configuration naming only one of them is therefore refused rather than read as zero for
the other; see
[SC-CFG-017](#sc-cfg-017--a-required-setting-is-required-member-by-member-not-as-a-block).

### SC-CANC-007 — The rhythm that decides the notice is the subscription's, not the plan's

🟢 A customer on a yearly subscription is owed the yearly notice, even where the same plan is also
sold monthly.

### SC-CANC-008 — No upper limit is placed on a notice period

🟢 The platform does not know whether an installation serves consumers or businesses, so the number
is the operator's to choose and the legal risk is theirs. What it costs is documented rather than
enforced.

### SC-CANC-009 — A missed notice deadline moves the cancellation to the end of the next period

🟢 A hard cut, not a grace period. It costs a customer real money, which is why the period a
cancellation lands in has to be stated before they confirm it.

_Source:_ #212

### SC-CANC-010 — A cancellation lands on the first period end that actually serves the notice

🟢 However long the notice is. Advancing by exactly one period gave a customer between 31 and 60 days
of a 60-day notice depending on which day they happened to declare — the operator promised sixty
and the customer received thirty-one. A misconfiguration should cost the customer a longer wait,
not cost the operator a promise the software cannot keep.

### SC-CANC-011 — A late cancellation extends the recorded commitment to the period it bought

🟢 Every other reader of the term end looks at the commitment, so a downgrade scheduled meanwhile
would otherwise land inside the period the customer had just paid for.

_Source:_ release 1.0.0-rc.6

### SC-CANC-012 — Declaring the same cancellation twice does not move it

🟢 The second press reports the existing cancellation and writes nothing. Where a notice period is
configured, re-deciding after the deadline pushed an on-time declaration a whole period further
out: the customer pressed the same button twice and bought a year.

_Source:_ #212 · release 1.0.0-rc.6

### SC-CANC-013 — Two cancellations arriving at once produce one

🟢 The second one reads back what the first wrote rather than replacing an on-time date with one a
period later.

_Source:_ release 1.0.0-rc.6

### SC-CANC-014 — A repeated cancellation does not explain itself with figures it cannot know

🟢 The deadline and whether the declaration was late come back as unanswered rather than recomputed,
because recomputing them would report a declaration that landed a period late as an on-time one.

_Source:_ release 1.0.0-rc.6

### SC-CANC-015 — A tenant who has cancelled is told from which date

🟢 And the act they have already performed is no longer offered to them. A tenant who cancels in
month three of a year and sees only the word "cancelled" has lost nothing yet and believes they
have.

_Source:_ #219

### SC-CANC-016 — A subscription is in one of three states, not two

🟢 Running; running with a cancellation still to come; over. The middle one is the one that gets
lost, and it keeps every entitlement it had until the date arrives. A page showing it follows the
effective moment on a timer rather than on the last render.

_Source:_ #219 · release 1.0.0-rc.6

### SC-CANC-017 — The period a cancellation lands in is stated before the tenant confirms it

🟢 Not afterwards, and not on a receipt.

_Source:_ #212

### SC-CANC-018 — The agreed contract ends when the subscription does, not when the customer declares

🟢 Both mistakes are available and both are wrong. Leaving it in force forever outlives the
agreement; ending it on declaration removes it from every lookup while the customer is still under
contract and still paying, so the invoicing side stops finding it.

_Source:_ #218 · release 1.0.0-rc.6

### SC-CANC-019 — Recording a cancellation is never blocked by something that follows it

🟢 If the contract could not be closed or the record of the act could not be written, the
cancellation still stands. A tenant is not left uncancelled because a secondary step failed.
